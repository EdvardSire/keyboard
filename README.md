# An efficient 40% keyboard layout
I have been fiddling with my 40% layout ever since i got my keyboard, and I believe that I've come up with some good ideas about the 40% layout that I haven't seen anywhere else online. You can upload the keyboard [JSON file](https://github.com/EdvardSire/keyboard/blob/master/niu_mini_layout_planck_mit_mine.json) at [QMK configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/#/) to view the layout layer by layer.

## Can you go smaller than 40%
The reason I bought a 40% was that i wanted the perfect keyboard, by that I mean the smallest possible, yet *efficient*, keyboard. Since i wanted a tiny footprint I went with an ortholinear 1 unit layout, ortholinear doesn't automatically mean smaller, since you can aruge that a keyboard's size is more accurately defined by its number of keys. I personally chose an ortholinear keyboard since i value the grid and smaller footprint. If we messure a keyboard by its grid footprint, I'd argue that a 4x12 keyboard is the perfect keyboard based on the following requirements:

* The letters take up a 3x10 grid
* The ESC and backspace key is on each side
* A centered spacebar on the bottom row

## Reducing capitalization to on key
## Enter's position on the 4x12
## Numbers without a number row
## Special characters
