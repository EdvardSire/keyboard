# An efficient 40% keyboard layout
I have been fiddling with my 40% layout ever since i got my keyboard, and I believe that I've come up with some good ideas about the 40% layout that I haven't seen anywhere else online. You can upload the keyboard [JSON file](https://github.com/EdvardSire/keyboard/blob/master/niu_mini_layout_planck_mit_mine.json) at [QMK configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/#/) to see for yourself.
